<div id="first"><p>I've been by Talde twice. The first time I stopped by was after watching a Timescast about dumpling places in NY. After seeing the pretzel dumplings they're pumping out, I knew I would have to go and check this place out. It just so happened that I ended up cat sitting in the same neighborhood a few weeks later, so I stopped over for some take out. You have to try these dumplings, they're outstanding. Basically next time you want dumplings, make the bee line for their front door, bzzz bzzz. Talde really brings it, and I would say they're certainly king in the Asian fusion area. The dumplings are a must have app, but on my first visit I also got the Hawaiian sliders which you'll also find pleasing to the palate </p></div>

<p>When I visited most recently, I went for dinner. They're not open before five most days, and we went on a Friday. It would be best if you booked reservations beforehand, otherwise its quite a long wait. We ended up sitting at the chefs table, a counter next to the kitchen. It was cool, but I would rather have been seated at a regular table, and you will too. </p> 

<p>We split the Soba noodle dish and the pork shoulder entree. The smoked pork shoulder was excellent, real tender. As far as the Soba noodle dish, I would try something different next time. They're are a bunch of interesting noodle choices, and it was daunting decision. I think I would go with the Pad Thai next trip, looks and sounds awesome The last thing I would mention is that we got the banana leaf sticky rice, it was good, next time I'll reach for the everything roti though. Add in a beer in the mix and you'll be set. On the basic tip, go here.</p>
