<h1><strong>Fu Run: Flushing Queens</strong></h1>

<div id="first"><p>I recently went out to Fu Run on a day off from work. 
I had wanted to try these lamb ribs I saw on the food network. 
Though this wasn't the exact place I saw on the tube, you know 
“Queens borough be the back drop” and this 
place got pretty good reviews. So there I was, sitting across from the Bland Houses 
(a housing project in flushing) flipping through the Fu Run Menu.</p></div>

<p>Fu Run has a large menu, and a lot of offerings, I was surprised. Who 
knew you could order jelly fish so many ways. Beyond the less mainstream items, 
they have some more generic dishes, chicken and beef variations. We had come for the lamb ribs, 
one order of which you'll find is plenty of food for two people, so we ordered these. These are 
really good, and I would definitely get them if you come. As you can see in the photo they have dry 
spices on the top. Piled high spices and fennel seeds pair perfectly with the lamb making happy patrons. 
These are really rich, so I would suggest getting a cola to wash them down.</p> 

<p>The only other item we ordered was a pancake filled with beef, fried, also good. I enjoyed the 
food tremendously, or whatever. I would mention that the service was poor, it was the end of the 
lunch shift and I always cut wait staff slack, because I've been there. However, if your of some noble
 lineage and aren't used to being ignored, I recommend staying in the palace.  </p>
