<h1><strong>Farid Kebab</strong></h1>

<div id="first"><p>This is my favorite food cart in Astoria, in a crowded great place for street food. Halal half chicken, chicken and beef kababs, cooked year round over charcoal. Absolutely delicious, and though the other reviewer felt the platters weren't a good value, I have to say I disagree. Platters are amazing, if you get the half chicken, it comes with two soups typically(depending on supply) and a salad. Its served over two types of rice, and though I usually get this platter for myself, the meal could easily be shared between two people. At ten bucks, well worth it. This is my favorite dish here, though the kabab sandwiches are great, reasonably priced, and served on toasted bread with the dough pulled out. </p></div>

<p>A couple of tips here, Sundays and dinner time hours you'll find yourself waiting for a long time, so be prepared to wait. It takes at least ten minutes even when there isn't a long wait. Though it says they deliver, I don't think that they do. I think they're overwhelmed with orders, and won't answer the number listed. I've tried, on several occasions, to call ahead for pickup without any luck. The last thing would mention is to ask for tahini. They used to only serve tahini and hot sause, but with the popularity of the ubiquitous white sauce, think they caved because everyone asks for it.</p> 

<p>Really great charcoal grilled food here.</p>

<h1><strong>Fu Run: Flushing Queens</strong></h1>

<img src="rib.jpg" alt="edible dialect"/> <div id="spkrbox"><pre><h2>90</strong></h2></br></br><img src="jackson.svg"/></br></br><img src="compassdraft.svg"></br></br><img src="menu.svg"></br></br><img src="phone.svg"></br></br><img src="Anyc.svg"/></pre></div>
</br>
<div id="first"><p>I recently went out to Fu Run on a day off from work. 
I had wanted to try these lamb ribs I saw on the food network. 
Though this wasn't the exact place I saw on the tube, you know 
“Queens borough be the back drop” and this 
place got pretty good reviews. So there I was, sitting in Flushing, flipping through the Fu Run Menu.</p></div>

<p>Fu Run has a large menu, and a lot of offerings, I was surprised. Who 
knew you could order jelly fish so many ways. Beyond the less mainstream items, 
they have some more generic dishes, chicken and beef variations. We had come for the lamb ribs, 
one order of which you'll find is plenty of food for two people, so we ordered these. These are 
really good, and I would definitely get them if you come. As you can see in the photo they have dry 
spices on the top. Piled high spices and fennel seeds pair perfectly with the lamb making happy patrons. 
These are really rich, so I would suggest getting a cola to wash them down.</p> 

<p>The only other item we ordered was a pancake filled with beef, fried, also good. I enjoyed the 
food tremendously, or whatever. I would mention that the service was poor, it was the end of the 
lunch shift and I always cut wait staff slack, because I've been there. However, if your of some noble
 lineage and aren't used to being ignored, I recommend staying in the palace.  </p>

<div id="first"><p>As the sign boasts Sal Kris is indeed "The Sandwich King," but not just "of Astoria" more likely the entire borough of Queens. In an out of the way local, it's definitely worth going off the beaten path for their signature sandwich "The Bomb," a sandwich so stacked with a variety cold cuts you'll test the limits of your jaw. This is a true grinder, at an astoundingly low price for the amount of food provided.  Typically I'll split "the Bomb" with a friend, half of one of these will more then quell your appetite. </p></div>

<p>I was abroad for two years, and this was one the first stops I made when i got back to NY. I would suggest eating this as soon as possible, as the bread tends to get soggy if you save it in the fridge.  Additionally Andy Cap's Hot Fries and a Manhattan Special Black Cherry are a good pairing.</p>
